A pluggable "GeoDjango":http://geodjango.org/ app with the boundaries of all states in the United States of America. Geography, loosely coupled.

<blink>Beware. This software is in beta testing and hasn't been used much. But don't let that stop you! Please try it and tell me what sucks.</blink>

h2. Features

* A ready-to-serve model with all the states in the United States of America
* Geometry fields for three of the most common SRIDs.
* Simplified geometry fields that thin down the data and make it easier to display many polygons on a single map.
* A read-only admin for reviewing the data
* The 2010 Census population total for each state.

h2. Requirements

Before you begin, you will need to have a Django project with GeoDjango's 'django.contrib.gis' app installed and configured. The official installation guide is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/. The official tutorial is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/. Both are excellent.

h2. Installation

h3. 01. Install the source code

You can download it from PyPi.
<pre><code>pip install latimes-pluggablemaps-usstates</code></pre>

Or, pull the trunk from github
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/datadesk/latimes-pluggablemaps-usstates.git</code></pre>

h3. 02. Install the app in your Django project

In settings.py's INSTALLED_APPS tuple, add the following.
<pre><code>'us_states',</code></pre>

h3. 03. Create the database tables

From the shell, enter:
<pre><code>python manage.py syncdb</code></pre>

h3. 04. Load the data

From the same shell, enter the following. Then go get a cup of coffee.
<pre><code>python manage.py loadusstates</code></pre>
